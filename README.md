# Fantasia

**Local-first AI operations desktop for safe creative automation.**

Fantasia is a desktop control room for builders who want AI tools to operate with receipts, rollback, and clear authority boundaries. It coordinates local services, operator queues, Codex/OpenClaw handoffs, FVE visual-engine workflows, and COAI / WordPress publish-readiness checks without turning every action into an unsafe live write.

## What It Does

- Starts scoped local work sessions.
- Shows local service and queue state.
- Routes handoffs between Faith, Codex, OpenClaw, and local operator lanes.
- Provides an FVE Workbench for image-review and website-change prep.
- Checks COAI / WordPress readiness while redacting credentials.
- Records checkpoints, task packets, verification runs, patch receipts, and rollback paths.

## First Use Case: FVE Website Visual Operations

Fantasia's first focused workflow is helping operate the FAYTH Visual Engine:

- review live website images
- keep passing images in place
- find weak, repeated, broken, generic, or line-drawn assets
- prepare replacements
- map candidates to target slots
- check COAI / WordPress publish readiness
- keep production publish guarded until rollback, target slots, typed slug, and production status are clean

Fantasia does not bypass FVE. FVE remains the source of truth for visual decisions and guarded publishing.

## Safety Model

Fantasia is local-first by default:

- no direct WordPress publish from Fantasia
- no credential values in UI logs
- no DNS/auth/plugin changes by default
- no social posting without approval
- no public dashboard exposure by default
- no hidden cloud telemetry
- no production writes without a specific guarded adapter
